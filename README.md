# Movie Pitch

a web application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (Davinci-003) model to generate compelling movie pitches based on your one-sentence movie idea. It provides you with a movie title, a detailed synopsis, and suggests a star cast for your films.

To run this project locally or integrate it into your own application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/oliveberch/moviePitch>
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in browser.

3. Obtain an API key from the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Replace `"Your API Key"` in the `env.js` file with your actual API key.
