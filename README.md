## Introduction

Movie Pitch is a web application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (Davinci-003) model to generate compelling movie pitches based on your one-sentence movie idea. It provides you with a movie title, a detailed synopsis, and even suggests a star cast for your imaginary film.

The project consists of an HTML/CSS front-end and a JavaScript back-end that communicates with the OpenAI API to fetch and display the generated content.

## Demo

You can try out the Movie Pitch app by visiting [Demo Link](#). Simply enter a brief movie idea, click "Send," and watch as AI generates an entire movie pitch for you!

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or integrate it into your own application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. To use the OpenAI API, you'll need to obtain an API key from the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Replace `"Your API Key"` in the `env.js` file with your actual API key.

4. Customize the project as needed, such as modifying the CSS to match your design preferences or adding additional features.

5. Deploy the project to your preferred hosting platform or web server if you want to share it with others.

## Project insights

While developing this project, I learned the following valuable lessons:

- **API Integration**: I gained experience in integrating external APIs into a web application and making API requests using JavaScript's `fetch` method.

- **Front-end Development**: I improved my front-end development skills, including working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.

- **Project Organization**: I learned how to structure a web project, separate concerns (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and manage dependencies.

- **UI/UX Design**: I gained insights into creating visually appealing and responsive user interfaces to enhance the user experience.
